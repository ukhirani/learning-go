## 📘 Self-Learning Go Programming

This repository documents my self-learning journey with the Go programming language. I'm following the renowned books:
* [**The Go Programming Language** by Alan A. A. Donovan and Brian W. Kernighan](https://www.google.co.in/books/edition/The_Go_Programming_Language/1Z80jwEACAAJ?hl=en).

The repo is organized with:

* ✅ **Coding Implementation of the topics**
* 📝 **Personal notes (Obsidian Vault**


Feel free to explore the repo if you're also learning Go — contributions or suggestions are always welcome!
